            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>I have been working as a Developer for over 4 years and am currently employed full time as a Software Engineer at On-Site.com. My focus is on, but not to limited to Front-End development, User Interaction and Data Presentation.

            I like to be versed in a variety of programming languages. JavaScript is my primary love but I also enjoy programming in ruby, C#, Java, ActionScript 3, python, and so on.

            Specialties: User Interaction, User Interfaces, User Experience, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Web Design, Web Development, (X)HTML, CSS, PHP, C#, ObjectOriented Development

            <hr>
            <h4>Data Visualization with JavaScript</h4>
            <p>I would like to discuss data presentation on the web while specifically using JavaScript as an aid. I would like to compare print charts and info-graphics with web based solutions, how they are different and how they help the user understand data. I would also like to show examples of a few sites that use charts effectively to communicate with their customers.</p>
            <p>I was initially inspired by a ted talk and would like to briefly skim over it as an introduction, but would like focus on developing a couple examples using JavaScript, and maybe even teaching a couple language specific concepts through this.</p>
            <p>I will try to get relevant data to on-site products to try and make this data relatable. If I am unable to get relevant on-site data, I will choose data from the net.</p>

Edward has been optimized with -O3 -funroll-loops since his Gentoo days in 2003.</p>

            <p>It ain’t easy being a SMIFY. What’s a SMIFY? I’m a SMIFY: a Short Minority Introverted Female who looks Young. Exactly. In this talk I’ll highlight 8 challenges I’ve faced as a SMIFY in the workplace, and reflect on how YOU can actually help me overcome them. (In fact, some of you already have!) This is not a talk about how women are really better than men, or “Mars vs. Venus.” The thing is that we’re all in the same boat and if one gender fails, then so will the other, and so we all need to help each other succeed. So get ready for a fun and hopefully enlightening ride.</p>

            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>I spent way too many years in college getting degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science, then spent most of the last 25+ years as a software engineer at companies like Bell Laboratories, Google, and On-Site, and also taught at DePaul University for a couple of years. Someday I'll decide what I want to do when I grow up, but in the meantime I've been happily working in Engineering at On-Site since 2010 and look forward to continuing to help design and build great systems here.</p>
            <p>My spare-time hobbies are earthquake safety (helping folks keep their families safer by preparing) and amateur radio emergency communications.</p>

            <h4>Dr. Strangelove:  How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Dates and Times</h4>
            <p>First we'll look at why dates and times are so frequently handled badly, and then I'll present a new way of looking at the problem that makes it easier to get correct answers.  This talk is not about any particular library; rather it is about how to *think* about time.  Warning: this talk contains bold assertions and surprise plot twists.</p>
